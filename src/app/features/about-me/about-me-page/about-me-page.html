  <h1>About — Mateusz</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Student &amp; freelance developer • Remote-first • Available for client work</p>

  <h2>Who I am</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Mateusz — a student and active freelancer who enjoys turning messy, complex problems into
    simple, maintainable solutions. I love working directly with clients and aim to grow into
    full-time freelancing. My work focuses on clarity, reliability and pragmatic delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>How I choose tools</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t chase buzzwords — I pick the right tool for the problem. That means choosing solutions
    that match the scope, timeline and future maintainability of a project rather than following
    trends. My priority is practical, robust outputs that make a client’s life easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Practically, that looks like pragmatic architecture decisions, sensible trade-offs between
    speed and scalability, and a focus on code that’s easy to iterate on. I adapt my approach
    to fit mobile, web or backend needs depending on what the project requires.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    For this portfolio I used Angular as I shifted some focus toward web development after working
    more on mobile and backend projects.
  </p>
  <p class="wp-note">
    I’ve also completed a couple of projects in WordPress and can work across different stacks to
    deliver the right outcome.
  </p>

  <h2>My approach</h2>
  <p>
    Simple principle: <em>make complex things simple</em>. I break problems down, remove the
    unnecessary, and deliver pragmatic solutions that are easy to maintain. I value clear
    communication with clients, iterative delivery, and practical design decisions that keep
    projects on time and on budget.
  </p>

  <h2>What I can help you with</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Freelance mobile development and client-facing features</li>
    <li>Backend scripts, automation and integrations</li>
    <li>Web applications and MVPs</li>
    <li>Small-to-medium projects where clarity and speed matter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Site images &amp; AI</h2>
  <p>
    All illustrations and site imagery are generated using ComfyUI and a variety of generative
    image models — a little experiment in applying AI to visuals while keeping the product
    human-focused.
  </p>

  <h2>Portfolio as resume</h2>
  <p>
    This portfolio doubles as my resume — see the Projects section for concrete examples and
    links. I keep project details separate so you can explore work samples and outcomes in their
    own space.
  </p>

  <h2>Languages &amp; hobbies</h2>
  <p><strong>Languages:</strong> English, Polish.</p>
  <p><strong>Outside of code:</strong> Gym / weightlifting and fishing — I value focus, patience and consistency both in
    training and development.</p>

  <h2>Work with me</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re a potential client and want someone who’ll simplify the complex and build something
    that works, <a class="cta" href="/contact">get in touch</a>. I respond quickly and enjoy
    discussing practical solutions. Remote-first and ready for freelance projects of all sizes.
