  <h2 i18n="@@whoIAmTitle">Who I am</h2>
  <p i18n="@@whoIAmText">
    I’m Mateusz — a student and active freelancer who enjoys turning messy, complex problems into
    simple, maintainable solutions. I love working directly with clients and aim to grow into
    full-time freelancing. My work focuses on clarity, reliability and pragmatic delivery.
  </p>

  <h2 i18n="@@howIChooseToolsTitle">How I choose tools</h2>
  <p i18n="@@howIChooseToolsText1">
    I don’t chase buzzwords — I pick the right tool for the problem. That means choosing solutions
    that match the scope, timeline and future maintainability of a project rather than following
    trends. My priority is practical, robust outputs that make a client’s life easier.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@howIChooseToolsText2">
    Practically, that looks like pragmatic architecture decisions, sensible trade-offs between
    speed and scalability, and a focus on code that’s easy to iterate on. I adapt my approach
    to fit mobile, web or backend needs depending on what the project requires.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@howIChooseToolsText3">
    For this portfolio I used Angular as I shifted some focus toward web development after working
    more on mobile and backend projects.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@howIChooseToolsText4">
    I’ve also completed a couple of projects in WordPress and can work across different stacks to
    deliver the right outcome.
  </p>

  <h2 i18n="@@myApproachTitle">My approach</h2>
  <p i18n="@@myApproachText">Simple principle: <em>make complex things simple</em>. I break problems down, remove the
    unnecessary, and deliver pragmatic solutions that are easy to maintain. I value clear
    communication with clients, iterative delivery, and practical design decisions that keep
    projects on time and on budget.
  </p>

  <h2 i18n="@@siteImagesTitle">Site images &amp; AI</h2>
  <p i18n="@@siteImagesText">
    All illustrations and site imagery are generated using ComfyUI and a variety of generative
    image models — a little experiment in applying AI to visuals while keeping the product
    human-focused.
  </p>

  <h2 i18n="@@portfolioAsResumeTitle">Portfolio as resume</h2>
  <p i18n="@@portfolioAsResumeText">
    This portfolio doubles as my resume — see the Projects section for concrete examples and
    links. I keep project details separate so you can explore work samples and outcomes in their
    own space.

  <p i18n="@@languagesText"><strong>Languages:</strong> English, Polish.</p>

    and consistency both in
    training and development.</p>
