  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a student and freelance developer who loves working with clients to bring their ideas to
    life. My focus is on creating simple, effective solutions for complex problems — always using
    the right tool for the job. Remote-first, client-centered, and ready to help you turn concepts
    into working products. <a class="cta" href="/contact">Let’s build together</a>.
